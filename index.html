          <h2>Mahiwagang<br><span>Salakot</span></h2>
          <p>Hiraya is a curious, 8 year old girl who is undecided about her dream career. While in school, she was saddened by the fact that, compared to her friends, she was the only one who did not have any grand aspirations. She sought solace from her grandfather and asked for his advice, who simply instructed her to search for his salakot inside their bodega.  Upon unearthing and grasping the salakot from a small box, the salakot shone and came to life, asking Hiraya if she would like a journey. Curiosity being her strength and her achilles heel, she accepted the salakot's offer and rode it to enter its magical world.
